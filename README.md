# Resume-Filtering-System

## Setup Process

This guide outlines the steps to set up the required Python environment and install the necessary packages.

To begin, create a Python virtual environment using Python 3.8. Make sure you have pip version 20.0.2 installed. Run the following commands:

```bash
python3.8 -m venv myenv        # Replace `myenv` with your preferred environment name
source myenv/bin/activate    # Activate the virtual environment
```
Git clone this repository
```bash
git clone <this repository>
```
**Download the [trained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xvCXp8b-SWXJnpEDTwCD9MF_uIarcdm_/view?usp=drive_link) and save the model file in repository's model directory.**

To use this system you need to install some necessary libraries that are mentioned in requirements.txt.
```python

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
